## Getting Started

We are all make typo mistake when we are fast and have this stupid bug we want to know why its comming so we console.log(errors or data) but in the middle of this, we type consoel or cosnole, its really annoing, so we add usually to the edditor cl short cut for typing console.log as snippit or template, but what if you can just pull this small file and type cl(data) or ce(data)
how nice that will be ?
